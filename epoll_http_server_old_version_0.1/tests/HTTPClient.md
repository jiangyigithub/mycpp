The code establishes a connection with a server using a socket, sends an HTTP request, and reads the server's response.

Here's an explanation of the code:

    A socket file descriptor sockfd is created using the socket() function with the parameters AF_INET (IPv4) and SOCK_STREAM (TCP).
    The servaddr structure is initialized with the server's address and port information.
    The server's IP address is converted from the text format to a binary format using inet_pton().
    The buff buffer is initialized with a null character.
    The p string contains the HTTP request to be sent to the server.
    The connect() function is used to establish a connection with the server specified by servaddr.
    If the connection is successful, the setSocketNonBlocking1() function is called to set the socket to non-blocking mode.
    The HTTP request p is sent to the server using the write() function. The length of the request string is printed to the console.
    The program pauses for 1 second using the sleep() function to allow time for the server to respond.
    The server's response is read into the buff buffer using the read() function. The number of bytes read is stored in the variable n.
    The number of bytes read (n) is printed to the console.
    The server's response is printed to the console using printf().
    The socket is closed using the close() function.
    The program pauses for 1 second using the sleep() function.

If the connect() function fails, an error message is printed using perror().

Note that this code assumes that the server is running and accessible at the specified IP address and port. It's also important to handle any potential errors that may occur during the connection or data transmission process.
